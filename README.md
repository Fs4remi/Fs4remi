## About Me 🚀

I'm a **Software Engineer** with experience in **developing backend services capable of automating complex workflows, making decisions with machine learning models, and processing large amounts of data**. I work at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) where I build tools using Python and AWS infrastructure. 

I am passionate about understanding the pain points of teams with data-heavy workflows and simplifying their complex processes by developing highly customized machine-learning-powered software. I spend a lot of time understanding the needs and use cases of users so I can design the high-level architecture plan of tools, develop and iterate through MVPs, and draft user interface mockups that front-end engineers could use as documentation.

Apart from client management, I have extensive experience in developing reliable event-driven APIs that integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems and databases. I enjoy translating manual processes into software solutions and discovering the best-fitting machine-learning algorithms for a problem at hand.  

In my free time, I volunteer with student education organizations that help Computer Science students find their place in tech.
