# Hi there, I'm Fatem 👋

## About Me 🚀

I'm a **Software Engineer** with experience in **developing backend services capable of automating complex workflows, making decisions with machine learning models, and processing large amounts of data**. I work at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) where I build tools using Python and AWS infrastructure. 

I am passionate about understanding the pain points of teams with data-heavy workflows and simplifying their complex processes by developing highly customized machine-learning-powered software. I spend a lot of time understanding the needs and use cases of users so I can design the high-level architecture plan of the tool, develop and iterate on MVPs, and draft user interface mockups that front-end engineers could use as documentation.

Apart from client management, I have expertise in developing reliable event-driven APIs that integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems and databases. I enjoy translating manual processes into software solutions and discovering the best fitting machine-learning algorithm to solve problems.  

I volunteer frequently to help Computer Science students get the most out of their education and find their place in tech.
